This is the *HotKitchen* project I made myself.

RESTful API

Stage 1/5: SignIn - SingUp
Create registration and authorization using the database with simple post methods. Connect the database, learn how to store information inside, and correctly process various requests.

Stage 2/5: Token usage
Add authorization and registration with the Bearer token. Explore the logic behind the Bearer JWT token and learn how to validate and get information from it.

Stage 3/5: Profile management
Add the user profile logic — create and delete a user and change their data. In this stage, you will learn how to manage the user profile using a token and particular HTTP methods.

Stage 4/5: Access rights
Let's allow customers to add and receive meals and categories of meals. Learn how to manage different access rights and, depending on the rights, grant access to specific methods.

Stage 5/5: Data management
Implement the order management: create an order, view a list of orders in progress, and complete order history.

<p>Master authorization, registration, managing access rights, database interaction, and processing JSON requests — all the fundamental skills for creating a full-fledged API.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/284">https://hyperskill.org/projects/284</a>
